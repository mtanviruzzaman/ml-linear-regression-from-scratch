* Solve linear regression using numpy:
    * In closed form
    * Using batch gradient descent
    * Using stochastic gradient descent

* Solve linear regression in Scikit-learn

* Solve linear regression in Pytorch
    * Single linear neuron

* Key points:
   * Too big a learning rate causes divergence
   * Unnormalized data cuses divergence
